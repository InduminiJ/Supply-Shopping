# Supply-Shopping

## Description

Python program I wrote during my first year.

The user enters their name, along with the names of their teammates. Then they are presented with a list of supplies and their costs. The user enters how many items they would like to purchase, and the total is calculated. 

## Usage

To use, simply download the git repository and cd into the file. The program can be run with the following command:

`python supply_shopping.py`
